1. Visual mode                                                      |swap-visual|

2. Normal mode                                                      |swap-normal|
        2.1 Repeating                                               |swap-repeat|

3. Operators                                                     |swap-operators|
        3.1 Custom operators                                    |swap-custom-ops|

4. Custom mappings                                         |swap-custom-mappings|

The functionality mentioned here is a plugin, see |add-plugin|. You can avoid
loading this plugin by setting the swap global variable in your |vimrc| file:
>
    :let g:loaded_swap = 1

1. Visual mode                                                      *swap-visual*

    1.1 \x~

    First select some text ([] represents the highlighted area). Then press \x
>
    [a ==   123] [  a == 123 ] [a==123]
          |            |           |
          V            V           V
     123 ==   a     123 == a    123==a
<
    Note: Your selection can be loose and include white spaces at both ends.

    1.2 \\x~

    By default the plugin acts on comparison operators |comparison_operators|
    You are however allowed to specify any pivot for the swapping.

    First select some text. Then press \\x
    You will be asked to give a pattern (% used here)
>
    Just testing  %  a percentage as a pivot
                       |
                       V
    a percentage as a pivot  %  Just testing
<
    1.3 Multiple lines~

    You can also use V, v or ^v to select several lines (v used), then press \x
>
    a == [123
    user !~ unknown
    0]!=#1
        |
        V
    123 == a
    unknown !~ user
    1!=#0
<
================================================================================
2. Normal mode                                                      *swap-normal*

    Swap with WORD on the right \x~

    # indicates the cursor position in the examples below.
>
          #
    zero one      a_longer_word three
             |
             V
    zero a_longer_word      one three
<
    Swap with WORD on the left  \X~
>
    zero one two     three
    let's have some more fun
      #      |
             V
    zero one two     let's
    three have some more fun
<
2.1 Repeat                                                          *swap-repeat*

    This plugin integrates with Tim Pope's repeat plugin. It means that you can
    use |.| to repeat any normal mode (for now) swap mapping you just used!

    For more information see: http://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat

3. Supported operators                                           *swap-operators*

        ===    !==     <>    ==#    !=#     >#
        >=#     <#    <=#    =~#    !~#    ==?
        !=?     >?    >=?     <?    <=?    =~?
        !~?     ==     !=     >=     =~     <=
        !~      ~=

         &&     ||

    Scope operators~
         ::

    Pointer operators~

         <<     >>

    Misc operators~
         >      <       =      +      -      *
         /      %       &      |      ^      .
         ?      :       ,     '=     '<     '>

3.1 Custom operators                                            *swap-custom-ops*

    You can define your own operators by putting a similar line in your |vimrc|:
>
    let g:swap_custom_ops = ['first_operator', 'second_operator', ...]
<
================================================================================
4. Custom mappings                                         *swap-custom-mappings*

You have the possibility to define your own custom mappings in your |vimrc|:
>
    vmap <leader>x         <plug>SwapSwapOperands
    vmap <leader><leader>x <plug>SwapSwapPivotOperands
    nmap <leader>x         <plug>SwapSwapWithR_WORD
    nmap <leader>X         <plug>SwapSwapWithL_WORD
<
Note: You can replace \x, \\x, \X with whatever you like.
